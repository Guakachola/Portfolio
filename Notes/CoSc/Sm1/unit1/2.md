	Remember to use VSCode, it has good syntax correction and is very user friendly. It can autofill with suggest functions for the user to input. It can tell you when you have mispelt words and functions.

### Syntax
	Comments are made by using three quotes: """ """;
	They are also made by single quotes: ''' ''';
	They exist so that other programmers and yourself can keep up with the brainflow and thoughts of the one that programmed the code originally. They maintain intention behind the code.

	from os input system 
	system("cls")
	This clears the terminal from clutter before code is written. It helps with readability and simplcitiy, but does not effect code produced.

	Input and output are defined by the user interaction with the console. Processes such as 'printf' let the user modify the print function to include additions and formating. This allows for multiple different ways to include variables in the print(f"...").
