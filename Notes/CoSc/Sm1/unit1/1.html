	<h3>
	The difference between Interperator and Compliler
	</h3>

	<p>
	When things are wrote by prjram, it is not comprehended by the computer. It
	is mere words, the computer can only under 'machine code' which is binary.
	This is where the interpretor comes into effect. It takes our language, like
	python, and intereprets it so that it is read as binary, 0's and 1's. The
	intepretor goes one line at once, while the compliler goes all at once.

	Interepretors are best for spot-checking, making sure one line of code works
	by itself, while the complier will add it up and see if the program can run
	altogether. Python does this all at once.
