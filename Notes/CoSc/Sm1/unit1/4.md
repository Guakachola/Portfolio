# Unit 4
	print(1 + 1) will print a Integer, not a String. Interseting to note. the function len() will store a value, as an integer, of the length of a String, nothing else.
	Anytime division is used, it will always include a decimal point, even if there is no remainder.

	Using // as an operator gives the quotient, without the remainder. % gives the remainder, without the quotient.
