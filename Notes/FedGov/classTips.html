	Always ask the syllubus before the professor.
	When emailing the professor, include ID and be professional.

   Expectations-
	
	Be well prepared for class, physically and mentally. Keep up
	with the readings, it will effect my grade if I don't. 
	Be professional in class as well, so keep the cell phone
	away to minimize distractions. It is important to pay 
	attention in this class for it can be useful in the future,
	even if it is a dumb college class.

	Regularly check email for invoices from Prof.. Similarly check
	Canvas and Microsoft Teams.
