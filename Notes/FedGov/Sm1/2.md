	The Virginia plan was for One house elected directly by the people. This means that Pop = Representation, which isn't very 'fair'. The president would then chosen by the legislature, which is a little corrupt. 
	The New Jersey plan advocaded for 1 vote per state, in order to protect the small states interests. 
	The Compromise for this Came through the Conneticut Compromise which had House, based on Pop, and the Senate,    which was 2 people per state.
