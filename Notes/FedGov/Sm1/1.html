		What Is Government?
	</h1>

	<h3>
		What is Power?
	</h3>


	<p>
	Power is the ability of one person to cause another person to act in 
	accordance with the first person's intetnions. Power is strong, and can
	be used inappropriatly and apporpiatly.
	</p>
	<p>
	Authority is what gives someone the 'right' to use power. Without 
	authrotiy, power is ill-given.
	</p>
	<p>
	The last play for power is Legitimacy. This is the moralization of power
	to determine whether it is constituted right or wrong. Legitimacy has 
	ebbed and flowed over time, and is prevelant in every government.
	</p>

	<h3>
		Max Weber
	</h3>
	<p>
	"Governmenmt is an institute in society that has a monopoly
	of the legitimate use of physical force."
	</p>
	<h3>
		George Washington
	</h3>
	<p>
	"Government is not reason, it is not eloquence-it is force"
	</p>
	<h1>
		What is Politics
	</h1>
	<p>
	Aristotle: Free people deliberating the question: How ought we to order 
	our lives together.
	</br>
	Laswell: Who gets what, when, and how?
	</p>
	<h3>
		Modern Definition
	</h3>
	<p>
	Dahl and Lindbolm: Government are orgs that enforce a monopoly of control
	to enforce order in disputes.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Two Key Functions of Government
	</h3>
	<p>
	1. Every Govern,ment is the locus of the ultimate power in its society.
	2. Its social function must at least include acting as the final 
	guarantor behind every use of coercion in the settlement of disputes.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Why Do We Need Government?
	</h3>
	<p>
	James Madison: If men were angles, no government would be necessary.
	The founders had a huge distrust in people's nature, which is why there
	are multiple checks and balances in the constitution. They thought that
	it is impossible to fix corruption, so instead, they we're to harness it
	and use it against the people.
	</p>
	<p>
	Governments are designed less for times when people agree than
	for times when they disagree. Do we kill them when they disagree, 
	eliminate them. Not in Demokracy. This is why government should not
	be trusted. Why there are three branches in our government.
	</p>
	<h1>
		Types of Government
	</h3>

	<h3>
		Governments by one: Monocracy
		</br>
		Government by reliogion: Theocracy
		</br>
		Government by many: Democracy
	</h3>
	<p> 
	Pervison: Tyranny; Oligarchy; Democracy; 
	</br>
	Non-perverted: Monarchy; Aristocracy; Polity;
	</br>
	Why would Aristotle think Democracy is bad? He thought that democracy 
	could lead to mobRule. That even if an entire people group think its 
	right, doesn't mean its right. People are generally uninformed, so 
	checks would need to be put on the people aswell. 
        </p>
	<h1>
		Democracy and Conflict
	</h1>
	<p>
	E. E.: Semisoveriegn people: A Realist View of American Democracy.
	He believed that conflict is contagious. How does one get other people
	get to their cause? Movements. Create a large movement to garner
	attention. This spreads the conflict from one to another, where there 
	might not be a reason for conflict at all, even deviating from its
	original source. It acts like a fire, consuming and engulfing and 
	changing. Similarly said, conflict is as succesful as it is outrageous.
	</p>
	<p>
	Schattschnieder: Democratic is the greatest instrument for the
	socialization of conflict in America. Why? It allows people to express 
	themselves. Resources allow people to express themselves more, whether
	that is money or people.
	</br>
	Democracy is a competitive political system in which leaders and orgs 
	define policy.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Pluralism
	</h3>
	<p>
	Pluralism is the belief that all interests are able to be expressed.
	</br>
	SS: The flaw of pluralism is that the most resourced are the most heard.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Democracy is a form of gov that allows for the greatest number of
		citizens to participate.
		More Participation creates greater conflict.
		Democracy takes several forms.
		Democracy is ever evolving
		The current evolution of Democracy affects governmental 
		efficiency.
